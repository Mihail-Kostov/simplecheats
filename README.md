============

Simple bash implementation of cli cheats idea.

## usage

    cheat [-e] cheatname

Opens cheatname in less, if it exists. If -e specified opens it in vim, for editing.

See .cheat dir, for existed cheats.

Some cheats (mutt, tmux and etc) contain my own application bindings.

## install

Simply run install.sh script. It'll be create symlinks in your home directory. Do not remove this repo after installing. For updates, just pull changes from git.
